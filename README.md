Project: FickleFlight - A UI/UX Concept for a Modern Travel Portal
Hello! This is my breakdown of the FickleFlight homepage design. As a student, my primary goal was to create a user-centric and intuitive interface that makes flight and hotel booking feel "hassle-free," just as the site's motto suggests.


The design focuses on guiding the user through a clear journey:

Immediate Action (Booking a flight)

Guided Planning (Exploring trip components)

Visual Inspiration (Discovering destinations and stays)

Engagement (Subscribing for updates)

1. The Hero Section: The Primary Call to Action (CTA)
The moment a user lands on the page, they are met with a clear and inspiring message: "Let's explore & travel the world". This sets an exciting tone.


User Task (UI): The main "SEARCH FLIGHTS" form is placed front and center. This creates a strong visual hierarchy, making it obvious what the user's primary action should be.

User Experience (UX): I simplified the booking process by:

Providing clear tabs for "Return" and "One-way"  trips.


Using straightforward input fields for departure (e.g., "Singapore (SIN)" ), arrival (e.g., "Los Angeles (LA)" ), and "Date".



Including a "RECENT SEARCHES"  feature. This is great for the UX of returning users, as it lets them quickly re-run a common search (like SIN to LAX ) without re-typing.


2. The "Plan Your Next Trip" Module
I recognized that travel planning involves more than just flights. This section  acts as a secondary navigation bar.


UI: It uses clean, simple icons for categories like "Hotel" , "Attractions" , "Eats" , and "Commute".




UX: This design choice guides users to other key parts of the travel "ecosystem" without cluttering the main navigation bar. It answers the user's "What's next?" question after they've considered their flight.

3. Visual Discovery: Inspiring the User
This part of the page is all about inspiration and discovery. I used a card-based layout, which is highly visual and easy to scan.


Most Popular Destinations & Recommended Holidays:



UI: These cards showcase a destination (like "Paris" or "Bali" ) and, most importantly, a clear starting price (e.g., "FROM $699" ).



UX: This helps users who don't have a set destination. They can browse visually and filter by price, which is a key decision-making factor. The "View all" links  encourage deeper exploration.



Popular Stays:


UI: This section also uses cards but includes more specific details like the accommodation type ("Entire bungalow" ), name ("Matterhorn Suites" ), and price per night.

UX: The most important UX element here is "social proof." By showing the rating and review count (e.g., "4.9 (60 reviews)" ), we build trust with the user, making them more confident in booking.

4. Final CTA: Newsletter Subscription
The final section before the footer is a clear Call to Action: "SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER".


UI: This section uses friendly, "party" language and simple fields ("Your name" , "Email address" ) to lower the barrier to signing up.



UX: This is a classic conversion strategy. Even if the user doesn't book a flight today, this feature allows FickleFlight to capture their email and re-engage them later with "weekly updates".

Footer
The footer provides standard, organized links for "Company" , "Support" , and "More" , ensuring users can always find help ("FAQ" ) or learn more about the business ("About Us" ).
